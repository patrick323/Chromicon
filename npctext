guide_text_chronicon="O Chronicon foi construído há alguns séculos como um grande monumento ao passado, a aqueles que lutaram - e morreram - para libertar o mundo do mal. ## Foi construído diretamente sobre um Grande Mausoléu, onde estavam todos os Heróis do Antigo que agora descansam."

guide_text_act1_summary="Your first trial will be to cleanse the corruption of The Fallen Temple. This temple was originally known as the Temple of Life, and was at the time dedicated to the worship of Ayeela, the Goddess of Life. But through a series of unfortunate events, Ayeela's most devout servant - the High Priestess Medella - suffered corruption from a powerful cursed amulet placed among the Temple's offerings.##The corruption took complete hold over her, causing her to sacrifice her apprentices in foul rituals, spreading the corruption through the entire temple, killing everyone present.##Your task, then, is to find Medella in the depths of The Fallen Temple and destroy her, just like the Heroes of Old did, many years ago."
guide_text_act1_cursed_amulet="The cursed amulet is simply known as the Black Skull Amulet, and not much is known about it other than its corruptive magic.##It was discovered when the priests and priestesses of the temple were investigating a sickness that was spreading among them. The foul amulet was found to be the cause, and so High Priestess Medella took it upon her and her apprentices to purify it.##They were sealed away in a prayer chamber, instructing the guards to not let them out until the purification was complete."
guide_text_act1_medella="Something went wrong when High Priestess Medella attempted to purify the amulet. We don't know what exactly, but we can only assume that the Black Skull Amulet held such an immense power that even the most devout servant of Ayeela could not hinder it.##When the seals of the purification chamber were undone, the most foul stench escaped the chamber. Inside they found Medella, covered in the blood of her apprentices, whose mutilated bodies riddled the floor around her.##From this day on, she became known as The Blood Queen, and for the following days, everyone who was unable to escape The Fallen Temple was sacrificed to fuel her corrupted mind."
guide_text_act1_cleanse="Eventually, a Templar order who worshiped Ayeela began a campaign to purify the temple. People from all walks of life joined them in their quest, and after many weeks a party of heroes finally ended the corruption by slaying The Blood Queen.##The Temple was purified the best they could, but there was nothing that could undo the desecration of life that had happened in that cursed place. As such, the temple was completely sealed, and remains so to this day.##The Black Skull Amulet, however, was never found."
guide_text_act1_end="Excellent! You've successfully walked in the steps of the heroes of Old, lived through their trials, and prevailed! This marks your first trial as complete, and you are well on your way to become a true Champion!##Now, please rest, then speak to me again about your next trial, whenever you're ready."
guide_text_act2_summary="Your second trial will be to participate in the Elven War, which took place about four centuries ago.##It was a war fueled by territorial tensions which eventually grew into full racist hatred. After a very aggressive and successful campaign launched by the bordering Human kingdoms, a powerful Elven druid was defeated, and diplomatic efforts began.##Your task will be to assist the soldiers in any way you can, and end the war."
guide_text_act2_escalation="Tensions arose as the Humans started to aggressively expand their territory, edging closer and closer to the sacred Elven forests. This obviously made the Elves feel threatened, and as such they started sabotaging the Human expansion.##First they did it slowly by agitating local animals and altering weather patterns, making hunting and farming difficult. This backfired completely, only motivating the Humans to expand even further towards the forests.##In an act of desperation, the Elves started escalating and using lethal force against the Humans. And eventually, the Humans had enough, and rallied an army for a counter attack."
guide_text_act2_hatred="During the diplomatic meetings following the human campaign, it was soon discovered that the hate Humans and Elves held for each other were fabricated.##A mysterious, and for centuries unknown, force had been working the races against each other, controlling them like puppets by infiltrating high ranking positions in both societies. This force eventually turned out to be a very reclusive race of physical beings, which we today call Demons.##But of course, back during the war, we had no idea of their influence, or existence."
guide_text_act2_peace="The peace that was forged in the post-war years, especially after discovering the Demon threat, was made absolute and lasts to this very day.##In fact, today most of us are both Elf and Human, and no one really cares to measure. We learned a valuable lesson from that war, and it acted as a catalyst for a new age - our current age - where peace reigns supreme.##Of course, there would be many conflicts in the next centuary or so - one in particular changed the entire fate of the world as we know it.##But there was never a new conflict between Elves and Humans."
guide_text_act2_end="Excellent! You've survived, and won, the old Elven War! This marks your second trial as complete, and now you're nearly halfway to becoming a true Champion!##Now, please rest, then speak to me again about your next trial, whenever you're ready."
guide_text_act3_summary="Your third trial will be to end the terror and madness that took place in Castle Clairebourg, one of the more remote Human kingdoms.##The great king Weyrick of Clairebourg suffered from a mysterious illness, growing worse every day, as his doctors were unable to cure him. The King sent for a renown Doctor from a far away land, to come to his aid and cure his illness.##The Doctor arrived promptly, but was unable to cure him. With the King's growing desperation and the Doctor's growing madness, they began performing horrific experiments on the King's loyal subjects.##Eventually the King passed from his illness, but the Doctor remained, tirelessly working, experimenting on the servants who had nowhere else to go, growing madder each day.##Your task will be to find, and kill, the Mad Doctor."
guide_text_act3_illness="It is to this day not known what illness the King suffered from. Historians have many theories, and some even claim that he was not ill at all, but cursed.##The King suffered for almost a year before he passed, and the last few months he spent bedridden, slowly withering away. The illness did not only harm his body, but it also turned his mind toxic and vile.##He was indeed a great King in life: compassionate, honorable, and true to his people.##The illness changed all that."
guide_text_act3_experiments="At some point, perhaps because of his increasingly warped mind, the King allowed to Doctor to begin doing tests on his loyal subjects.##At first they were relatively harmless, but over time the experiments grew into complete torture and mutilation. Screams were heard from the laboratory day and night, and the servants prayed to be spared such a horrible fate.##Hundreds died at the hand of the Doctor."
guide_text_act3_passing="Eventually King Weyrick passed.##The records claim he passed peacefully in his sleep, though what peace one may have after what they had done is debatable.##The King had no heir, so there was no one to succeed him in Castle Clairebourg.##And as such, the servants had nowhere to go, and with great remorse, they remained under the tyrannical rule of the Mad Doctor."
guide_text_act3_end="Excellent! Yet again you triumph! Not only did you end the madness of the Doctor, but you also freed the old King from his eternal undeath. You are making excellent progress, and only two trials remain!##Now, please rest, then speak to me again about your next trial, whenever you're ready."
guide_text_act4_summary="Your fourth trial is a little different from the previous three.##This trial is one of exploration, discovery, and overcoming a harsh wasteland. You will step in the footsteps of a band of heroes who rescued and teamed up with our history's most famous archaeologist and explorer, Diana Jones.##Together, they traversed The Great Wastes, uncovering secrets of ancient civilizations, and ridding the inhospitable desert lands of fierce beasts and barbaric Orc tribes.##Your task is simply to find and rescue Diana Jones, then follow her lead as best you can."
guide_text_act4_the_wastes="To do this day, The Great Wastes are still inhabited by many fierce creatures, and they still hide many secrets beneath the sands.##Due to Diana Jones and her heroic companions however, several regions were made relatively secure, allowing civilization to settle and blossom around the few water sources available.##Today some of the greatest cities in the world lay in The Great Wastes, and in them you'll find Humans, Elves, Goblins, and even Orcs - living side by side."
guide_text_act4_diana_jones="Indeed, Diana Jones was perhaps the most important person in Human history when it comes to archeology and exploration.##She discovered some truly marvelous things during her time in The Great Wastes, and would come to discover something quite the opposite in a later expedition, which came to change the entire world as we know it."
guide_text_act4_ancient_civ="In The Great Wastes, Diana Jones and her companions found proof of what had only been speculated before: there existed ancient civilizations before us.##What we learned of them is highly limited, but what we know for sure is that they faced a great cataclysmic event, destroying their cities and wiping them out nearly entirely.##A few of them survived and were able to hastily document the event. From what we have been able to decipher, they spoke of molten skies and violently trembling land.##A truly horrifying event, and a mystery yet to be solved."
guide_text_act4_end="Excellent! Once again you emerge triumphant from the Trials of The Chronicon! Now, only one trial remains. Prepare yourself well, for this is no ordinary trial. Speak to me when you are ready to begin."
guide_text_act5_summary="Your fifth, and final, trial will be your greatest one yet.##We will send you back to fight in The Last War, the very war that brought this everlasting peace and prosperity we are currently living in. You will serve as an elite soldier under the most powerful leaders of Elves, Men, Orcs, and Goblins. Yes, this is the war in which we all fought together to end our common foe, the Demons.##As you may recall, some time after the Elven War, it was discovered that an unknown power - which turned out to be the race of Demons - had been pulling at the strings for centuries.##In this trial, you will destroy them all."
guide_text_act5_unification="Indeed, it was a challenge to get all the facts right and untwist all the lies and mistrust between all the peoples of the world. Though once it had been done, it became entirely clear that we needed to unite against our common foe. And so we did, cautiously at first, but once the fighting began our bonds would grow ever stronger, and our unity lasts to this very day."
guide_text_act5_mostly_humans="Yes, despite the unity there are almost exclusively humans both entering and caring for The Chronicon. We all have our different traditions and methods of remembering and honoring the past - this one is ours.##The Orcs, for example, still practice ritualistic Shamanism, and are able to link with the souls of the past that way. The Elves use their Druidism to connect to the earth itself and remember that way. We use our technology. And the Goblins, I'm told by Tinka, does something in-between. Of course, everyone is welcome to participate in either tradition."
guide_text_act5_end="Congratulations! You have now witnessed first hand how we fought to unite the world against those who sought to control us.##With this trial completed, you have earned the honorary title of Champion. And now, something else entirely awaits you, should you accept. Speak to Tinka to learn more. Once again, congratulations!"

enchanter_text_enchanting="Enchanting may seem tricky at first, but don't worry, I'm here to tell you all about it! Enchanting is divided into three categories: scrambling, re-rolling, and augmenting.##They all do different things and cost different amounts of materials, which also depends on the rarity and calculated value of the item itself."
enchanter_text_scrambling="Scrambling is perhaps the most interesting service I offer. When you scramble an item, all enchants that aren't locked are removed, and new ones are applied randomly, as if you found a completely new item!##If you like any enchant that appears after Scrambling, you can Augment it to lock it into place, and keep scrambling the remaining enchants!"
enchanter_text_augmenting="If you like an Enchant on an item, you can Augment it. This will not only lock it into place so it won't be Scrambled and you cannot Re-roll it, but it will also strengthen the Enchant!##Through Augmenting, you can make most Enchants stronger than they can be found naturally.##Keep in mind that the cost and maximum effect of Augmentations are decided by the rarity of the item."
enchanter_text_rerolling="Re-rolling Enchants can be useful if you have bad luck and get a low value on an Enchant you want to keep and Augment.##Re-rolling is cheaper than Augmenting, and will re-roll the selected Enchant to anywhere between its minimum and maximum value.##It's more likely to roll closer to the maximum value, which makes Re-rolling an useful feature!"
enchanter_text_locked_enchants="Some Enchants always appear on certain items, these can be Re-rolled but not Scrambled, and will appear in an orange color. However after Augmenting any Enchant it becomes locked, and can no longer be either Re-rolled or Scrambled.##I can't do anything about that, though I've heard that Theo, the Transmuter, can help you out, provided that you know the recipe."

gemcutter_text_gems="Gems you find are stored in a separate tab in your inventory, where they are sorted by their material, which also coincides with their element type.##There's one Gem type for each element, and there's three types of Gems per element. These types are Sphere, Cube, and Star Gems, and they all come in three rarities."
gemcutter_text_socketing_gems="The Gems must match the sockets on the items, and different shapes provide different bonuses, even when they're the same element. In addition to that, the Gems will also provide different bonuses when socketed into different item types!##It's a lot to keep track of, but don't worry, it'll quickly make sense once you get started."
gemcutter_text_upgrading_gems="Gems can also be upgraded by combining them, but keep in mind that Gems cannot be upgraded after they've been socketed into items!##Normally you only find the first two rarities of Gems, and to get the third and strongest you need my help.##Five Gems of one rarity and a few Crafting Materials will get you a single Gem of the next rarity."
gemcutter_text_removing_gems="You can also remove Gems from your equipment. This, however, destroys all the socketed Gems in the process!

ween_farmer_sickle_complete="Ah! Minha foice favorita! Obrigada. A árvore foi plantada no túmulo de meu tataravô. Grande homem. Ele adorava abóboras. Significa muito para mim. Alguma ideia para onde foi? Espero que volte."
ween_farmer_pumpkins_complete="Que boa colheita. Digo, colher abóboras não é tão divertido? Não consigo imaginar fazer outra coisa!"
ween_farmer_pests_complete="Bom trabalho! Não pode haver pragas devorando a colheita, porque se não, não sobrará colheita para colher. Se você entende o que quero dizer."
ween_farmer_undead_complete="Great job with the undead! Can't have the undead eating the harvester, because then there is no harvester to harvest the harvest. You know?"
ween_farmer_done="Hey-ho, thanks for helping me out and stuff, you sure de-spookified my fields. Hope you enjoy that pumpkin I gave you! It's real special-like."
guide_ween_intro="It has come to our attention that The Chronicon may be... leaking. Manifestations conjured by The Chronicon have appeared in a nearby field, disrupting the harvest and hurting the farmers. Considering the fact that its energies are leaking, this likely means that other things conjured by it will exist in the outside world, such as your equipment. So with that in mind, we'd like you to go and investigate what's going on in the fields. Look for a farmer by the name of Isaac. He'll tell you what's going on."
guide_ween_done="I see. And your equipment did indeed manifest in the real world? This is concerning. But I am glad it's resolved, for now."
guide_ween_call="Campeão! Temos um assunto urgente para discutir."
